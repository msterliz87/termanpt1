<br><i><stronger><h1 align="center"> WINNIE THE POOH </h1></stronger></i></br> 
<i><smaller> Winnie-the-Pooh, collection of children’s stories by A.A. Milne, published in 1926. Milne wrote the episodic stories of Winnie-the-Pooh and its sequel, The House at Pooh Corner (1928), for his young son, Christopher Robin, whose toy animals were the basis for many of the characters and whose name was used for the young boy who appears in the tales as the benign master of the animals. </smaller></i>




<br> 
<b><smaller><h2 align="center"> The main character, Winnie-the-Pooh (sometimes called simply Pooh or Edward Bear), is a good-natured, yellow-furred, honey-loving bear who lives in the Forest surrounding the Hundred Acre Wood (modeled after Ashdown Forest in East Sussex, England). His companions are Eeyore, a gloomy gray donkey; Piglet, a timid pig; Owl, a pontificating bird; the meddlesome Rabbit; and Kanga, an energetic kangaroo whose inquisitive baby, Roo, lives in her pouch. </h2></smaller></b>

Pooh, a self-described “Bear of Very Little Brain,” <br>
 gets himself into all kinds of sticky situations, <br> 
and the book’s 10 chapters recount his various adventures. <br> 
In the first chapter, Pooh hears bees in the treetop and <br> 
believes they must be making honey. <br>
After unsuccessfully attempting to climb the tree, <br> 
he uses a balloon to pretend he is a cloud, <br>
 but the bees are suspicious.<br>
Deciding they are the wrong sort of bees, <br>
Pooh realizes he is unable to get down, <br>
and he enlists the help of Christopher Robin, <br>
who pops the balloon with a gun. <br>
In a later adventure, Pooh visits Rabbit and, <br>
after eating too much, gets stuck in Rabbit’s doorway. <br>
For the next week, Pooh fasts while Christopher Robin keeps him company. <br>
Finally he is slim enough for the others to pull him free. <br>
Pooh’s kindness is also evident, <br>
notably when he finds Eeyore’s missing tail in chapter four. <br> 
Later in the book Pooh demonstrates his bravery when he and <br> 
Christopher Robin set off in an upturned umbrella to rescue Piglet from a flood. </h3>

The stories are simply written, to appeal to young readers, 
and full of comic moments as well as silly verses. 
However, the work also is notable for its insights into human behaviour, 
and Milne’s characters are endearing but also complex. 
E.H. Shepard’s original illustrations add to the charm of the book 
and helped make it a children’s classic.  
In The House at Pooh Corner Milne introduced another popular character, 
an exuberant tiger named Tigger. </stronger></br></h4>
